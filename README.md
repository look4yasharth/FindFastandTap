# Find Fast and Tap
This watchOS game that I built is a fun game for little children. In this, the child will see four different colour boxes with the colour name written inside respective boxes. There will be one box in each frame with a wrong colour name mentioned inside it. For example – a purple box will have ‘RED’ mentioned inside it. There are 10 frames i.e. 10 wrong answers – one in each frame. The child has to quickly find such boxes, one in each frame, and tap on them. A timer will be running and the child has to finish up identifying incorrect mentions as quickly as possible. In the end, the child will see a display containing total time taken by him/her to find all the incorrect mentions. There will also be an option to ‘PLAY AGAIN’. Hence, this is a Learning while Playing kind of app for children. 

Many apps and games plan prompts in the system to nudge the user to come back later again. That’s exactly what I have implemented in this application. After every 5 seconds, a notification will come that will nudge the child to come and play the game again. There is an option to use calender or interval trigger for the same. At the same time, this 5 seconds time interval can be altered.

In this project, I learnt about raising alerts, menu designing, timer controlling, working with notifications and shuffling array of colours.
